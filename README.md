# KRY Application - App

### Prerequisites

Nothing that isn't handled by gradle.

### How to run:

No special steps need to be taken when using Android Studio.
I ran the app in an emulator though (Nexus 6P), since I don't have an Android device right now.
Make sure `SERVER_URL` in `MainActivity.java` points to where you deployed the API.
